## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("/Users/WN/Desktop/summer2022bridge/FALL2022TIDYVERSE/archive/allDogDescriptions.csv")

head(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r deleting-columns}
data %>% transmute(
  id,
  org_id,
  url,
  species,
  breed_primary,
  breed_secondary,
  breed_mixed,
  breed_unknown,
  color_primary,
  color_secondary,
  color_tertiary,
  age,
  sex,
  size,
  coat,
  fixed,
  house_trained,
  declawed,
  special_needs,
  shots_current,
  good_w_children = env_children,
  good_w_dogs = env_dogs,
  good_w_cats = env_cats,
  name,
  status, 
  posted,
  contact_city,
  contact_state,
  contact_zip,
  contact_country,
  description
) %>% filter(status == "adoptable" & good_w_dogs == "True")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
